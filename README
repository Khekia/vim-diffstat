A plugin for running git diff --stat. It allows you to view the stats for
several diffs; just run:

   :DiffStat [commit ...] 

For example: if you wish to view what files have changed since your last commit,
what files have changed in your last commit, and what files differ from master,
you can run the following:

   :DiffStat HEAD HEAD..HEAD~1 master


NOTE: This is an alpha release. Expect a lot of fixes and improvements over the
next couple of weeks.
