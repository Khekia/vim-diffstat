1. Introduction                             *diffstat-intro*

DiffStat is a plugin which allows you to run `git diff --stat` in a Vim window.
Hitting <cr> (Enter) when the cursor is on a file name opens that file for
editing.

The standard command line returns paths relative to the git toplevel directory,
and simplifies paths. This plugin aims to preserve simplified paths in an 80
character terminal, but make them relative, and easy to follow. In addition, it
supports syntax highlighting to make the result easier to read.

2. DiffStat usage                           *diffstat-usage*
                                            *diffstat-:DiffStat*

This plugin can be invoked using the :DiffStat command. When inside a repo, run
:DiffStat [commits..] to open the DiffStat window.

  Some examples are provided below:

    :DiffStat                         Diff against the current tip.
    :DiffStat work                    Diff against the work branch.
    :DiffStat HEAD~1                  Diff against the parent of the tip.
    :DiffStat HEAD~1..HEAD~2          Show what changed in the parent of HEAD.
    :DiffStat HEAD HEAD^ HEAD~2       Diff against the last tip, it's parent,
                                      and grandparent.

Running DiffStat in a git repo will open a window containing the diff[s].
Hitting <cr> in normal mode opens the file under the cursor.

3. DiffStat Options                        *diffstat-options*

DiffStat is configured via several global variables that you can set in your
|vimrc| file according to your needs. Below is a comprehensive list of
the variables available.

Git command                                *g:diff_stat_git_command*

Use an alternate git command.

  Example: use the git1.8.0 binary in /usr/local/bin

    let g:diff_stat_git_command = '/usr/local/bin/git1.8.0'

Path simplifications.                     *g:diff_stat_path_simplifications*

Define custom path simplifications for use in longer file paths. The keys in
this dictionary are path patters, and the values are replacements. This can be
useful in codebases with very deep directory structures. When a directory path
is too long the plugin will first attempt to use these simplifications to
shorten the path. It can provide more meaningful path names than calling
|simplify()| which is done in the default case.

  Example: Simplify some common paths in the Linux kenel source.

    let g:diff_stat_path_simplifications = {
    \ 'kernel/power/trace': 'k/p/tr',
    \ 'a/pcc': 'arch/ppc',
    \ 'a/bf': 'arch/blackfin'
    \ }
